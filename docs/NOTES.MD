# VPN Speed Testing Modes

This file contains notes on different modes for testing VPN speeds. Each mode has its own characteristics and considerations.

## Modes

- **Speed Server Mode**: This is the traditional method of connecting and then checking the speed. It's a direct method but may not always yield the best results as you've demonstrated.

- **Ping City Mode**: This probably checks the latency to different cities in a country. Lower latency can sometimes correlate to faster speeds, but not always. It's a quicker way than connecting to each server but may not always be the most accurate in predicting speeds.

- **Ping Server Mode**: This checks the latency to each individual server in a country. It's more granular than the city mode, and as you've demonstrated, it can sometimes yield much better results. However, it can be time-consuming if there are many servers in a country.

- **Speed Test Mode**: Just tests the current connection's speed, without trying to change servers. Useful as a standalone utility or for diagnostic purposes.

- **Lowest Load Mode**: This could be a good strategy. Servers with lower loads might provide better speeds. You'd need a way to get the load data for each server, but many VPN providers do expose this.

- **Historical Mode**: Keeping a record of your own experiences is an intelligent approach. Servers that have historically provided good speeds for you might continue to do so. This mode would need a database or some persistent storage mechanism to keep track of speeds over time.

- **ULTIMATE MODE**: This mode would combine data and strategies from all the other modes. It could first check historical data, then if there's no conclusive decision, it could check server loads, then ping times, and then finally do direct speed tests. It would be the most thorough but also the most time-consuming.

## Next Steps

- **Implementation**: If you want to proceed with building out these modes, you'll need to decide on the priority and start implementing them one by one. Some, like the historical mode, will require more infrastructure (like a database) than others.

- **Optimization**: Once you have the basic modes working, you can look at optimizing. For instance, if pinging every server is slow, maybe you can do parallel pings to speed it up.

- **Interface**: Consider building a simple CLI interface or even a GUI to make using your tool even more user-friendly.

- **Documentation**: As with any tool, clear documentation on how to use each mode, and what each mode does, will be beneficial.
