## VPN Connection Optimizer Roadmap

1. **Finalize the Tool** any ideas you have just put here:
    - Ensure that all the modes in your tool are working perfectly.
    - Consider adding detailed logging and error handling.
    - Implement a user-friendly interface, even if it's command-line-based. Good UX can make a significant difference. 
    - Maybe use Cobra or another CLI framework to make the tool more robust. Check it out. and have option like vpn_optimizer install to install globally, and have script that builds and installs the package OS wide, and if you do vpn_optimizer --info you get list of commands
    - if the desired speed is not specified, the tool should automatically choose the fastest server(meaning go trough all servers and test them and then choose the fastest one)
    - idea?: have online version, where they can enter their IP? or I get it automatically and test the servers using that? so just give them a server name. and then they just connect. This way i can practice cloud and deployment, using web services, etc...
    - it doesn't work for us servers
    - if country not specified assume the current closes country you are in. the one vpn would connect automatically.

2. **Documentation & Readme**:
    - Create a comprehensive `README.md` for GitHub.
    - Document every mode and feature with examples.
    - Maybe include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you're open to collaborations.
    - add that this is a good tool if you are streaming stuff and want to make sure you have the best speed possible. e.g. you connect to a streaming platform to watch something that is geo restricted, and you want to make sure you have the best speed possible, so you use this tool to find the best server for you. 
    - add to README that the reason for this creation is that I noticed that vpn provider doesn't neccesarily connect you to the fastest server, and that I wanted to make sure I have the best speed possible, so I created this tool to find the best server for me.

3. **Licensing**:
    - Decide on an open-source license for your project, e.g., MIT, GPL, etc. This determines how others can use or contribute to your project.

    <br>

4. **Create a Blog Post**:
    - Detail the journey of creating the tool, the challenges faced, and how you overcame them.
    - Highlight its unique features.
    - Embed speed test results, comparisons, and other visual aids.
    - If possible, create a tutorial on how to use it.

    <br>

5. **Social Media & Forums**:
    - Share the blog post and the tool on LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit (in relevant subreddits), and developer forums like Hashnode, Dev.to, and others.
    - Engage with comments and feedback.

    <br>

6. **YouTube / Video Content**:
    - Consider creating a video walkthrough of your tool.
    - Showcase speed tests, comparisons, and real-time use cases.

    <br>

7. **Engage with the Community**:
    - Address GitHub issues promptly.
    - Join discussions related to VPNs and suggest your tool where relevant.
    - Keep an eye on user feedback and update the tool accordingly.

    <br>

8. **Monetization Initiatives**:
    - Set up a "Buy me a coffee" or Patreon link on the GitHub page and in your blog post.
    - Consider a freemium model if the demand is there and if you plan to add more advanced features.
    - Offer consultation or customization services if there's demand from businesses.

    <br>

9.  **Expand the Tool**:
    - Based on feedback, consider supporting other VPN providers.
    - Add features that users demand the most.
    - Maybe create a GUI version if there's enough demand.

    <br>

10. **Networking**:
    - Attend developer conferences, webinars, or workshops (either in-person or virtual).
    - If your tool gains substantial traction, consider giving talks or workshops on it.

    <br>

11. **Collaborations**:
    - Encourage other developers to contribute. Review and merge pull requests.
    - Collaborate with bloggers or content creators to spread the word.

    <br>

12. **Ongoing Content Creation**:
    - Regularly blog about updates, new features, and user testimonials.
    - Share these updates on social media to keep the momentum going.

    <br>

13. **Re-evaluate and Iterate**:
    - Every few months, review the progress.
    - Update the roadmap based on what worked and what didnâ€™t.
    - Consider exploring indirect monetization channels if your blog or GitHub repository starts getting significant traffic.
